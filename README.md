A little dice game i coded as a practical exercice alongside an online course on JavaScript. This trained me on the manipulation of the DOM with JS.

<h2>Rules</h2>
  The first player rolls the dice. If he rolls between 2 and 6, the number gets added to his current score. 
  He can roll the dice as many times as he wants as long as he doesn't roll a 1. Rolling a 1 removes all the added score and gives the turn to the other player.
  Any player can hold his current score in order to save it, this gives the turn to the other player.
  The goal is to be the first to reach an accumulated score of 100.
